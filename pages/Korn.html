        Korn is an American nu metal band formed in 1993 in Bakersfield,
        California. They pioneered the nu metal genre by blending heavy metal
        riffs with hip-hop, funk, and industrial influences, featuring downtuned
        guitars, aggressive rhythms, and Jonathan Davis’s distinctive vocal
        style. Their self-titled debut (1994) gained underground attention,
        while albums like Life Is Peachy (1996) and Follow the Leader (1998)
        brought mainstream success. Throughout the 2000s and beyond, Korn
        continued to experiment with electronic elements and alternative sounds,
        influencing countless bands and maintaining a reputation for dark,
        intense lyrics and energetic live performances.

        "Metal isn't necessarily aggressive. There's metal that's contemplative,
        there's metal that's sad, and there's metal that's exuberant.
